# Workshop Description
We increasingly rely on personal and professional advice generated and curated by algorithms, rather than friends and family.

In the first session of this workshop, we start by discussing the historical context of search and recommendation systems.
Next, we delve into the mechanisms behind these systems, which heavily rely on state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
The process involves converting implicit and explicit user preferences into structured data that can be computationally analyzed to provide valuable recommendations.
Additionally, we examine how search can be seen as a specialized form of recommendation.

In the second session of the workshop, we focus on the efficient implementation of these computations using contemporary distributed computing methods.

## Requirements
To join the workshop, you'll need a device with a recent web browser and two-way audio and video access to Zoom. This could be a laptop or desktop computer running any operating system, such as Windows, Mac, or Linux. Participative activities benefit from a larger screen, so joining via a smartphone or tablet may not provide the best learning experience.

You do not need to install Python or any other software before the workshop. We will provide more detailed instructions prior to the start to ensure that you are set up and ready to learn.

Our goal is to create an inclusive and supportive learning environment, and we want all students to succeed.
However, to set you up for success, we also want to clearly communicate the necessary level of prior knowledge and programming skill.
If you are unsure whether you have the required background, please feel free to reach out for guidance.


## Outcomes
Workshop attendees will be positioned to leverage their newfound expertise in search and recommendation systems to contribute to industry practices and make informed decisions on the implications of these increasingly prevalent technologies.

Specifically, attendees will:
  * Develop a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of recommendation systems, along with their relationship to search systems. They will grasp the underlying deep learning mechanisms and techniques employed in these systems.
  * Acquire practical engineering skills essential for efficiently implementing recommendation systems at scale.
  * Learn skills for building recommendation systems for diverse applications, empowering them to contribute to the advancement of the field.
  * Gain insights into the state-of-the-art practices of machine learning within prominent Silicon Valley companies that rely on search and recommendation systems for adding value.
